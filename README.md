# UCSM in Swift

This repository is for communicating with UCS using Swift and in this case, an iOS device.  

The idea is that it's not fully functional, but provides a good starting point for building a more complicated application that can communicate with UCS Manager and do all the cool things you've been wanting to do with a mobile device.
