# UCSM in Swift

This repository is for communicating with UCS using Swift and in this case, an iOS device.  

The idea is that it's not fully functional, but provides a good starting point for building a more complicated application that can communicate with UCS Manager and do all the cool things you've been wanting to do with a mobile device.  

## Building

When you download the project, you'll need to build the pods.  I've included a Podfile for you so all you should have to do is run: 

```
pod install
```
and it will grab all the dependencies and go along it's merry way.
